In centralized environments, we can use linear version numbers to represent a version, such as incrementing a number each time or using timestamps. However, CRDTs can be used in decentralized environments, and their version representation is different.
In Loro, you can express a document's version through a [Version Vector (opens in a new tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector) or Frontiers.
In most cases, you might only need the Version Vector, which can be used for data synchronization and version comparison.
To understand the difference and the definition of `Frontiers`, see [Loro's Versioning Deep Dive: DAG, Frontiers, and Version Vectors](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive)
