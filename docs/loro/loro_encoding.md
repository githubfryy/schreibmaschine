> Loro 1.0 has stabilized the data format and will not have any breaking changes.

Loro introduces three encoding modes to meet the needs for different use cases:

-   Updates Encoding: Encodes all or a specified range of operations, mainly used for delta updates of documents.
-   Snapshot Encoding: Encodes the entire document, including both all the operations and the current document state.
-   Shallow Snapshot Encoding: Loro 1.0 provides a new encoding format for discarding useless historical operations. It is a special snapshot that encodes the most recent historical operations, the starting state of the remaining history, and the latest state of the document.

Different encoding formats are provided through the unified `doc.export(mode)`, and all binary encoding formats can be imported via `doc.import(bytes)`.


## Updates Encoding


There are two modes for updates encoding. `update` å’Œ `updates-in-range`.

-   `update` mode will encode all ops from the from version to the latest version of the document.
-   `updates-in-range` mode will encode all ops within the specified version range.

Updates Encoding selectively encodes operations from a chosen initial version to the most recent, enhancing support for real-time collaboration by focusing on incremental changes rather than the entire document state.


## Snapshot Encoding


Snapshot Encoding comprehensively captures a document's current state and its historical operations. This mode can quickly obtain the latest document state.


## Shallow Snapshot Encoding


Loro will save all editing history to resolve conflicts and history backtracking. However, for most scenes, most of the older history is useless, taking up too much extra memory and requires more storage space for saving.
Loro 1.0 provides a shallow snapshot encoding mode. You can specify the starting historical version to be retained, and Loro will truncate all the history before this version.
Note: When using shallow snapshots, you cannot import updates that are concurrent to the snapshot's start version. For details, see [shallow snapshot](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/shallow_snapshot).


## Loro's Snapshot File Format


To support lazy loading capabilities, we referenced common storage formats in databases, introduced a simple LSM engine, and abstracted the encoding results as simple key bytes and value bytes representations, preparing for future integration with common key-value databases.


### Encoding Details


In Loro, multiple consecutive Ops of the same Container are merged into one Change, i.e., one commit record. Each Change has additional metadata, such as ID, Lamport, Timestamp, etc. In most scenarios, Changes are also consecutive, and related metadata can be compressed to some extent. Therefore, we combine multiple consecutive Changes into a ChangeBlock, which is the minimum unit for encoding Op history. Detailed encoding content can be found in the [documentation (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/blob/main/crates/loro-internal/src/oplog/change_store/block_encode.rs).
We use the first Change ID of the ChangeBlock as the query key, and the encoded ChangeBlock as the value. This allows for quick querying of specified ID Changes and their Ops without decoding all Changes.
The complete State is composed of the states of all Containers starting from the Root Container. The key is the bytes representation of the ContainerID, and the value is composed of each Container's metadata and the bytes encoded according to its own semantic state expression.
These key-value pairs will be stored in our implemented simple LSM structure.
The final exported encoding will be divided into four parts: encoding header, oplog bytes, latest state bytes, and shallow state bytes.
The Header consists of a 4-byte magic number, 16-byte checksum, and 2-byte encode mode.
The oplog bytes, latest state bytes, and shallow state bytes are all exported using the [LSM encoding structure (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/blob/main/crates/kv-store/src/lib.rs).
