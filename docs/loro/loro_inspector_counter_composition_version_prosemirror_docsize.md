Loro Inspector

[Loro Inspector (opens in a new tab)](https://inspector.loro.dev/) is an open-source web tool that helps developers debug and visualize Loro documents. It provides a user-friendly interface to inspect the state and history of Loro documents.

Counter

Loro's Counter will add up all the applied values, and supports integers and floating point numbers.
Here is how to use it:

```
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const counter = doc.getCounter("counter");
counter.increment(1);
counter.increment(2);
counter.decrement(1);
expect(counter.value).toBe(2);
```

Composition

In Loro, you can build complex data structures using basic CRDTs such as List, MovableList, Map and Tree. These containers can include sub-containers, which in turn can contain more sub-containers, allowing for the composition of intricate data structures.
It's important to note that documents in Loro must adhere to a tree structure. This means that while a parent can have multiple children, each child is restricted to only one parent. Therefore, the document forms a tree rather than a graph (like a DAG).
By leveraging these fundamental CRDTs, you can effectively model the states and the updates of documents that conform to the JSON schema.

Version

In centralized environments, we can use linear version numbers to represent a version, such as incrementing a number each time or using timestamps. However, CRDTs can be used in decentralized environments, and their version representation is different.
In Loro, you can express a document's version through a [Version Vector (opens in a new tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector) or Frontiers.
In most cases, you might only need the Version Vector, which can be used for data synchronization and version comparison.
To understand the difference and the definition of `Frontiers`, see [Loro's Versioning Deep Dive: DAG, Frontiers, and Version Vectors](https://loro.dev/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive)

Docsize

In this benchmark, we use the Automerge paper dataset.
Source: [https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index (opens in a new tab)](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-perf/tree/master/edit-by-index)
The dataset consists of:

-   182,315 single-character insertion operations
-   77,463 single-character deletion operations
-   A total of 259,778 operations
-   104,852 characters in the final document

The first line of settings in the table below indicates configurations without `gc` and `compress`.

> The `x` in the table above signifies that the corresponding setting is not supported.

Loro also supports a shallow snapshot encoding format with gc capabilities by truncating the history. For details, see [the doc](https://loro.dev/docs/tutorial/encoding). If truncated from the latest version, the result will be:
