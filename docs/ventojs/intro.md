Vento is the [Galician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galician_language) word for *wind* but also a new template engine for Deno and Node. It's inspired by other engines, such as [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com/), [Eta](https://eta.js.org/), and [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/).


## [Why another template engine?](#why-another-template-engine%3F)


All these template engines mentioned above are great but they also have some drawbacks and none of them meets all my requirements, so I've created Vento.


### [Nunjucks](#nunjucks)


-   It's not well maintained. The last version was released in Jun 2022. And the previous version in 2020.
-   It's not async-friendly. For example, you have some tags to work with sync values (like `for` and `if`) and others for async values (like `asyncEach` and `ifAsync`). Some features don't work in async contexts.
-   To me, it's very uncomfortable to have to type the delimiters `{%` and `%}` all the time (especially the `%` character).
-   By default, all variables are escaped, so you have to remember to use the `safe` filter everywhere. This is not very convenient for my use case (static site generators), where I can control all the content and the HTML generated.


### [Liquid](#liquid)


-   It's not possible to invoke functions in a liquid template. For example `{{ date.format("YY-mm-dd") }}` fails.
-   It has the same problem as Nunjucks with the `%` character in the delimiters.


### [EJS/Eta](#ejs%2Feta)


-   It has the same problem with the `%` character. And I don't like the opening and closing delimiters (`<%` and `%>`).
-   I like it can run javascript, but it's very inconvenient to do a simple `forEach` or `if`.


### [Mustache](#mustache)


-   Perhaps too simple and the syntax can be a bit confusing.
-   Partials. It's not easy to include them dynamically.
-   The data context is a bit confusing to me.
-   Very uncomfortable to work with filters.


## [Vento syntax](#vento-syntax)


First, let's take a look to the following example:
```
<header>
  {{ if printName }}
  <h1>{{ (await getUser(34)).name |> toUpperCase }}</h1>
  {{ /if }}
</header>
```

-   Everything is between `{{` and `}}` tags. Unlike Nunjucks or Liquid, there's no distinction between tags `{% tag %}` and printing variables `{{ var }}`.
-   Vento, like Eta/EJS synstax, allows to use JavaScript code inside the tags. For example `(await getUser(34)).name` is real JavaScript executed at runtime.
-   Like Nunjucks, Liquid or Mustache, there are some specific tags like `if` for common things like conditions, loops, etc. The closed tag is done by prepending the `/` character (like Mustache).
-   It's async friendly, you can use `await` everywhere.
-   Filters are applied using the pipeline operator.
