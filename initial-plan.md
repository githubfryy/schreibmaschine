now go with me in planning mode. 

i want to build a collbaritve writing app for my creative writing workshop.
it should be local first - work in a offline lan via docker and be really easy for non technical people to participate it - all technical stuff can be low level via code - i will do this - but a nice admin experience would be nice

bun and eylisa will be the backbone of the app - html for the frontend  modern 2025 vanilla html with modern 2025 vanilla css + alpinejs3.14.+ (+ plugisn maybe ajax alpinejs) will be the frontend. Everything shall be handled in one package.json in the root
loro crdt will be the way to use collab editing when needed - loro prosemirror for markdown compatible writing editor experience.

but first i want to concentrate on the db architecture with bun and elysia - the rest like frontend and collab editing and at last the docker deployment will follow later.

as data i want to have 
- workshops ("Sommer 2025", "Frühling 2024", "Sommer 2024", etc.)
- writing groups ("Zusammen schreiben", "Schöne Lieder", "Sonettenmaschine", "Hörspiele", etc.)
- participants ("Lisa", "Laura", "Nils", "Jonas", "Rebekka", "Edna", "Richard", "Samira", etc.)

a workshop hast  multiple writing groups and multiple participants

participants can go to more then one workshop

a writing group is just a concept in itself at first with tools of the app to use - it should be plannable in a neutral state to prepare for a workshop

a writing groups then can get added to a workshop - this makes in bound to this workshop - the concept of the writing group (maybe as a template) could be the basis of another writing group later

a writing group then belongs to a workshop and will have some participants

these connection should be always be visible when i check - if Nils is in the Hörspiele group in Sommer 2024 - i want to see this when i look at the Details of Nils, of "Sommer 2024" workshop or of the writing group Hörspiel (Sommer 2024) 

when people to a workshop group and log in there should be a state attached in the backened to this person that he is online in this group. later i want to use this state from the frontend to show who is in the group at the moment and who is allowed to be in the group but not online at the moment.

every group room should have a lobby where you land when you are note logged in. in the lobby you can click on the person you are - only persons who where put into the group will be shown here.

if you get to the lobby from another device (tablet or so) you can log in also as this person and see you own notes that you wrote on the first device. the others see you as the person you are - regardless of the device. 

logging into a group should be as easy as possible - just click on a person and save a persistent browser cookie as a credential. nils has a unique id in the backend - in the frontend he is nils in every group he enters. 

admin rights are important for me to make changes to anmes of workshops, groups, persons. at first it is enought to have the admin url - a small password check can be installed later - as well for the participants if just clicking wouldnt be enough (but for now it would be enough!)

please outline the database backend structure with all this information and ask questions if you want to plan better. the backend should be really solid before i go to the frontend. 
in the frontend i want to have a dashboard later to see in real time who is in which group und in which workshop and who is online in which group - but these should be signals or websockets into the backend so that i do not have to write complicated frontend code - just checking the backend information. also it will be important to have the same information on different parts of the app - so the backend is the one truth.

please use a modern typescript approach (input by perplexity in @/docs/modern-typescript.md) - please also use biome and a strict typescript to have a direct feedback if all routes are well built and have an easier time developing. i use windsurf code editor at the moment and also installed the bun plugin for vs code and the biome plugin (also claude code plugin).

use modern vanilla css - input by perplexity in @/docs/modern-vanilla-css.md

please put these files in your memory: release notes for bun from 1.2.0 to 1.2.19 @/docs/bun-release-notes.md and for elysia from 1.0 to 1.3 (and to 1.3.19) @/docs/elysia-release-notes.md

when we will use other tools to bun and elysia i will provide modern release notes and code examples. until then use these and ask for modern release notes when using new tools.




  Questions for Better Planning

  1. Database Choice: Would you prefer SQLite (simpler, local-first) or PostgreSQL
  (more features, better for scaling)? SQLite seems perfect for your local-first,
  workshop-based approach.

answer: SQLite

  1. Authentication Admin: For the admin interface, would a simple password-protected
  route be sufficient initially, or do you want something more sophisticated?
  
simple password protection

  2. Session Management: Should the "online status" persist across browser restarts,
  or reset each time someone closes/opens their browser?

if nils went to the lobby and clicked on his name / logged in then his online status changes to "in this room" if he closes this window he is out of the room (but not if be is in another tab - then he is still in the room). if the pc went to standby he is not in the room i think. if he closed the tab and opens on another device we will be online again.
if he is online on the pc and wants to open again on a tablet he will be asked if this is what he wants - but he can do this with no problems and remains online in this group.

  3. Writing Group Templates: When you create a writing group from a template, should
  it copy the template or reference it? (Copy seems better for independence)

a group can consist of elements like a collab writing pad for the whole group ar collab writing pads for just a portion of the group or of writing pads just for each particpent indivudually. also there can be writing tasks like "drawing" empty sheets of colored paper and writing something on it and then put them "in the middle of the table" and then draw three of alle the colored papers that were put on the table by the group. i want to build these tools for the groups later - but please know that they will be there so the backend can cope with them intellegently. 
i also like a game of writing 1 line - then give the paper to your neighbour who can see your line and has to write anothre that rhymes - the she gives it to the next and they see only the last written line and have to write another one that rhymes.

  4. Participant Uniqueness: Should participant names be unique globally, or can you
  have multiple "Nils" across different workshops?

it can be so many workshops and participants that the same name will be used more then once or twice. so the admin can write a full name for everyone - but the displayed name can be nils two times - no problem. i can change it do nils o. if i want to differenciate - but only the admin is allowed to change names and displayed names

  5. Real-time Updates: For the dashboard showing who's online, would WebSocket
  connections work, or do you prefer Server-Sent Events (SSE)?

please use the web and check which would be better for a local first app that people can use in an offline state when they just write their own document. i am not sure what is better. i want to use loro crdt - which works better there? later i want to have to examples as test for the frontedn - on with datastar 1.0 RC4 and one with alpinejs 3.14.9 (inculding plugins lage alpinejs persist and alpinejs ajax (3rd party))

  6. Data Persistence: Any specific requirements for data backup/export since this is
  local-first?

All written documents should be exporable as markdown. the database export is something for later - but note it it.


  The architecture I'm proposing will give you:
  - Clear separation between writing group concepts (templates) and actual workshop
  instances
  - Full bidirectional relationships (you can see Nils' workshops from his profile,
  see who's in Hörspiele from the group view, etc.)
  - Simple online status tracking with browser cookies
  - Flexible workshop-group relationships that maintain history
  - Easy admin interface potential with full CRUD operations
  - Real-time capabilities for dashboard updates

  Would you like me to proceed with this structure, or do you have adjustments based
  on these questions?

Additional Questions

  Writing Activities & Tools Architecture

  1. Activity Types: From your examples (collaborative pads, individual pads, drawing
  colored papers, rhyming game), should I design a flexible "activity" system where
  each writing group can have multiple activities of different types? Something like:
    - activities table with type (collaborative_pad, individual_pad, paper_drawing,
  rhyming_chain, etc.)
    - activity_participants for who can access what
    - activity_data for storing the actual content/state

--- 

  2. Rhyming Game Architecture: For the "write one line, pass to neighbor" game -
  should I track the sequence/order of participants? And store each "turn" as a
  separate record so you can see the progression?

  Session Management Details

  3. Multi-Device Handling: When Nils is online on PC and wants to open on tablet -
  should I:
    - Show a popup "You're already online on another device, continue here?"
    - Allow seamless multi-device access
    - Track which device was "most recently active"?
  4. Session Persistence: Should I store session history (who was online when) for
  admin insights, or just track current online status?

  Participant Management

  5. Participant Display Names: Should I have separate fields for:
    - full_name (admin editable, like "Nils Olsson")
    - display_name (what shows in lobbies, like "Nils")
    - And handle duplicates by showing "Nils" and "Nils O." in the same room?

  Group Flexibility

  6. Group Templates vs Instances: When you create a group from a template, should the
   new instance:
    - Copy all the template's activities/structure
    - Allow the admin to modify which activities are included
    - Remember which template it came from for updates?

    - activity_participants for who can access what
    - activity_data for storing the actual content/state
--- answer:
the person who directs a group (the teamer) can decide what activities he or she wants to have represented in the app and then use them with their group - most createive writing groups consist of differnt phases - first and idea gathering on a collab document (that maybe only the admin can edit at first) - then the colored paper sheets as input for ideas that will be randomly drawn to have "assignements" - then individual writing and then bringing to stories together on a 2-collab-editor by two people who will write a mashup story of their two stories

  2. Rhyming Game Architecture: For the "write one line, pass to neighbor" game -
  should I track the sequence/order of participants? And store each "turn" as a
  separate record so you can see the progression?
answer:
it should be like a paper that gets folded so that i can see only what the person before me wrote. we play it with x sheets for x people. everyone writes the first line and gives it to the next person - who sees only the last line, writes his and gives it to the next person - who sees only the last line, writes his and so on

  should I:
    - Show a popup "You're already online on another device, continue here?"

answer: Allow seamless multi-device access

  4. Session Persistence: Should I store session history (who was online when) for
  admin insights, or just track current online status?
answer: just track current online status 

  Participant Management

  5. Participant Display Names: Should I have separate fields for:
    - full_name (admin editable, like "Nils Olsson")
    - display_name (what shows in lobbies, like "Nils")
    - And handle duplicates by showing "Nils" and "Nils O." in the same room?
answer: full_name only in the backend and admin panel - on the frontend only displayed_name
duplicates in the same room should not be a backed concern - we will solve it ourselves be renaming the displayed_name or just having two nils

  Group Flexibility

  6. Group Templates vs Instances: When you create a group from a template, should the
   new instance:
    - Copy all the template's activities/structure
    - Allow the admin to modify which activities are included
    - Remember which template it came from for updates?

anwer: for now as uncomplicated as possible - i think it will be useful when creating a new group to use older groups as a starting point - but please think for yourself what for our little group would be best and not too complicated

  Real-time Architecture

  Let me research the WebSocket vs SSE question for local-first apps with Loro CRDT...

● Web Search("Loro CRDT WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events offline-first collaborative
            editing 2025")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 21s                                                              

● Web Search("DataStar htmx alpine.js realtime updates WebSocket SSE 2025")
  ⎿  Did 1 search in 25s                                                              

● Perfect! Based on my research and your answers, here are my insights and remaining
  questions:

  Real-time Architecture Recommendation

  Based on the research, Server-Sent Events (SSE) is the better choice for your
  local-first app because:

  1. DataStar 1.0 RC4 is built around SSE and signals - perfect match for your
  frontend choice
  2. Loro CRDT works well with SSE since it handles conflict resolution automatically
  3. Offline-first compatibility - SSE reconnects automatically when connection is
  restored
  4. Simplicity - One-way server-to-client updates are perfect for status changes and
  notifications
  5. Alpine.js compatibility - SSE integrates well with Alpine.js reactive updates

  For the collaborative editing with Loro CRDT, you can use SSE to broadcast document
  changes, while Loro handles the offline merging when users reconnect.

  Remaining Questions for Perfect Backend Design

  Activity System Architecture

  6. Activity Progression Tracking: For games like the rhyming game, should I design
  it as:
    - Linear progression: Person A → Person B → Person C → Person A
    - Or flexible turns where admin can set the order?
    - Store each "turn" with timestamp and sequence number?

answer: everyone should see the order (like people sitting around a table see the order) - the admin can rearrange the order around the "table" 
if someone has no idea what to write they can "check" and just give it to the next person (but have to make an extra confirm click)

  7. Activity States: Should activities have states like "setup", "active", "paused",
  "completed"? This would help manage when people can join/participate.

answer: the admin or teamer can open a group and close a group. a admin and teamer cann add participants to a group and remove them. these states should be represented in the backend.

  Participant & Session Details

  8. Lobby Behavior: When someone clicks their name in the lobby, should they:
    - Immediately enter the group room?
    - Go to a "personal workspace" first where they see their individual activities?
    - Or directly to a group overview showing all activities they can participate in?
answer: its like a real room - they can sit on a table and write for themselves and see the other and see some of the material already. so a shared room but with their personla view of the room

  9. Offline Writing Storage: For individual writing that happens offline, should I:
    - Store drafts locally in browser (IndexedDB) and sync when online?
    - Create a "personal workspace" table in the database?
    - Or handle this entirely through Loro CRDT documents?
anwer: i do not know what would be best. loro crdt for everything could be on the one hand easier because it is the same mechanism always even for personal docs. on the other hand individual notes do not need the overhead (but is it overhead when loro crdt will be used on other tools?) i dont know what the best way is. i now that i want a seemless local first experience for peaple who write on their laptops their stories "offline" and it should be synced as soon as they see the server again. that is a frequent occurence in thick buildings in the outer country

  Admin Interface Scope

  10. Admin Capabilities: Beyond changing names and creating workshops/groups, should
  the admin be able to:
    - Pause/resume activities mid-session?  -- (why? they can close a room but nothing should be deleted then - the room should be reopenable )
    - See live previews of what participants are writing? -- no "peeking over the should" - some system of having all written texts after the fact would be really good - but every participant should have the option the not "publish" their work
    - Export individual participant work or group work separately? -- 
    - Set activity time limits or deadlines? -- yes there will be timed events in some writing groups

  Data Structure for Writing Content

  11. Document Storage: Should I store the actual writing content:
    - As Loro CRDT documents in the database (binary/JSON)?
    - In separate files referenced by database records?
    - Or let Loro handle storage entirely and just track metadata in SQLite?

-- answer: something i do not know. i use markdown for a later archiving and documentation of my workshops - please check what would be best 

  Your answers will help me design the perfect database schema that anticipates all
  these features while keeping it simple and performant!

URL Handling

one more thing - every group has a url where it can be reached - this url is handled in the backend too. there will be one url based on the unique id of the group like "localhost:3000/gruppe-p6" or "localhost:3000/gruppe-Lz" but they also have a url based on the workshop it is on and the group name. the normal slug for a workhsop should be made like this "Frühling 2025" to fruehling_2025 and a group of "Schöne Hörspiele im Winter & danach" to schoene_hoerspiele_im_winter_danach and the sharable url is then localhost:3000/fruehling_2025/schoene_hoerspiele_im_winter_danach

i want to be able to edit the url and the changes should imeadeatly shown in the sharable url like localhost:3000/fr25/hoerspiele

if someone tries to reach localhost:3000/fruehling_2025/schoene_hoerspiele_im_winter_danach and is not logged in - they will go to a lobby like: localhost:3000/fruehling_2025/schoene_hoerspiele_im_winter_danach/vorraum (and not see localhost:3000/fruehling_2025/schoene_hoerspiele_im_winter_danach even in a flicker) and then log in from there

please do not write big html chunks in typescript but use html files for this - so much easier on the eyes - always document where you put the views and the ts parts of the app so you have no problems to know this app after i cleared your context
